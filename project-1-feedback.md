Hi Kendra,

I really enjoyed looking at this project! There is a lot happening here that is subtle and strong.

I'm breaking my feedback here into two parts - technical and conceptual.

#### Technical

##### HTML
- Understands Open/Closed Tags function and placement: **yes**
- Understands tags with required closures vs no closures: **yes**
- Understands essential blocks of a web page (e.g. "html", "head", and "body"):
Make sure that all of your visible content that a viewer would see is always inside the **body** tag. Right now you have your images and links outside of the **/body** and **/html** tags. Move those before the closed body tag **/body** tag and you will be great.
- Understands linking to external CSS document: **yes**
- Understands how text formatting tags should be used (e.g. H1 for headings, p for paragraphs): **yes**
- Understands how image paths are referenced in image tags (img) and image format (e.g. .jpg, .png, etc) is present: **yes**
- **Not required** Understands how items used for links should be wrapped with anchor tags (a): **yes** - ***wonderful!***
- **Not required** Understands how individual HTML pages are created and linked to to create a website: **yes** - ***awesome, glad you did this, it works well!***

##### CSS
- CSS Document successfully linked to and style information pulled into HTML document: **yes**
- Understands how tags in HTML (e.g. body, h1, p, etc) correspond to tags in CSS: **yes**
- Has no competing or contradictory style attributes: **yes**

##### Tech Notes
Fabulous job technically! You explored a lot of elements in HTML that weren't required and have demonstrated a clear understanding of how HTML is structured and how documents are linked to and sites are expanded. Just be sure that your visible content appears inside the **body** and **/body** tags. Otherwise everything looks good!

#### Concept Notes
- Glad that you pushed the boundaries of the requirements - the title as a featured part of the page ("nightmare in hiding") sets the tone for the work and strengthens how I am meant to read the images and their relationship to the poem.
- The images as isolated items on the page as a scroll (where the margin between them is so thick I can't see the last image) draws my focus heavily to the content of the image and nearly forces me to contemplate it, coupled with the iconic strength of each image, there's a nice synthesis of mood starting to happen. The creamy color around the image situates it almost as a photograph in space with a photo mat around it - which allows me to see the image as somewhat precious.
- Each image has only 'traces' of people - which coupled with their symbolism (egyptian mummies, cavernous cathedrals, or foggy dreamy and dreary scenes) and the poetic content (allusions to isolation, death, a place where "lightning has fled" which I assume is either otherworldly or below ground or outside of the 'dynamic world', I am getting a strong mood of eerie fantasy. I am wondering if these symbols and references were meant to operate in sort a macabre or ghastly way? As right now they are putting me almost in a sci fi or fantasy space. No right or wrong, but I'm curious of your intention.
- Disclosing pieces of the poem in individual pages is a very strong move - for me it isolates those lines and forces me to focus on their meaning while reinforcing this unseen/desolate/isolation motif. It also causes me to question if my memory of the last line makes sense. I wonder if those individual pages could have their own imagery or styles that then reveal more hidden or subverted icons or symbols?

Great job Kendra. This is really strong! I would love to see this go even further. If you liked the direction this was going, maybe keep this work in mind for your narrative video game project.
